## üîç About the Project

We set out with a mission: **Explore the threat landscape, understand vulnerabilities, and propose actionable solutions.** 

The result? A hands-on deep dive into the **tools, techniques, and tactics** used by both attackers and defenders in the digital world. From exploiting SQL injections to scanning live environments, this is the real deal.

## üß≠ Project Phases

### **Stage 1: Manual Vulnerability Assessment**
> **Objective**: Understand core vulnerabilities through direct interaction.

- **Target**: [DVWA](http://www.dvwa.co.uk/) *(Damn Vulnerable Web Application)*
- **Environment**: Kali Linux VM
- **Tools Used**: `Burp Suite`, `Browser-based payloads`
- **Exploits Performed**:
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - CSRF
  - Command Injection
  - Broken Authentication

---

### **Stage 2: Automated Vulnerability Scanning**
> **Objective**: Simulate real-world scanning using OWASP-grade tools.

- **Tool**: `OWASP ZAP`
- **Target IP**: `192.168.137.220`
- **Findings**: 15 vulnerabilities
- **Severity Breakdown**: High | Medium | Low
- **Bonus**: Full `ZAP-report.html` included in the repo

---

### **Stage 3: Research & Awareness Drive**
> **Objective**: Explore the human and institutional angle of cybersecurity.

- **Topics Researched**:
  - Malware, Phishing, Ransomware
  - Social Engineering & Insider Threats
  - College Cyber Hygiene Best Practices
  - The Future of Threat Intelligence, AI, & IoT Security
